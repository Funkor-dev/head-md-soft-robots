# EXERCICE 1
Spend the next 20 minutes brainstorming a list of possible areas or specific situations where your soft robot could be used or interact within a home environment. Focus on where the robot could be placed (could be decentralised, could be hidden) and how it might interact with its surroundings, rather than what it would look like.

> 1.  Place : Sofa. When someone sits and relax on the sofa, it would play Music for Airport's album. 

> 2.  Situation : When the main door is opened for the first time after few hours, it would spread and diffuse attractive smells around the living room. 

> 3.  


# EXERCICE 2 
Building on your ideas from Exercice 1, create a list of potential interactions and feedback mechanisms for your soft robot. Focus on how it communicates with its environment and users. Aim to find precise ters that describe these interactions. Then, brainstorm possible input-output scenarios, without worrying about technical feasibility for now.

# EXERCICE 3 
Using your ideas from Exercice 1 and 2, write a short paragraph in markdown that describes what your soft robot does, where it resides in the home, and who it interacts with. Feed this text to an AI and begin an iterative process to refine your to refine your concept.
Following this, create a series of quick prototypes that summarize the key points from your concept and your conversations with the AI.
