# THOUGHTS OF 10-21
I was completely alone in my living room saturday evening, eating my meal, when I suddenly realized all of my roommates were at home but nobody was making any noise. I was feeling lonely in that space, surrounded by very silent presences, and still in the need of some direct company. 

Also waiting too long to note manifestations of my roommates, I ended up meditating on their absence and their ghostly presence. 



# EXERCICE 1
Spend the next 20 minutes brainstorming a list of possible areas or specific situations where your soft robot could be used or interact within a home environment. Focus on where the robot could be placed (could be decentralised, could be hidden) and how it might interact with its surroundings, rather than what it would look like.

- **1.**  Place : Sofa. When someone sits and relax on the sofa, it would wait a few seconds or minuts before playing very quiet Music for Airport's album. (I find this idea maybe too much obvious and not precise)

- **2.**  Situation : When the main door is opened for the first time after few hours, it would spread and diffuse attractive smells around the living room to signal the presence. 

- **3.** Delivering the message of someone to their roommate staying at home the whole afternoon. (not sure about this idea for now)

- **4.** (Hidden, like a global rumor.) A robot generating very quiet pleasant sounds when nobody is talking for a while in the living room, these sounds being sampled and reshaped from conversations it heard few hours before. 

- **5.** Place : table of the living room. A robot that would become happier -and manifest it for the next five hours- when feeling a presence around itself. It would become very sad after twenty hours without anybody for company. 

- **6.** A robot that would capture and collect the presence of people it saw the last few hours, then forgetting them.


# EXERCICE 2 
Building on your ideas from Exercice 1, create a list of potential interactions and feedback mechanisms for your soft robot. Focus on how it communicates with its environment and users. Aim to find precise ters that describe these interactions. Then, brainstorm possible input-output scenarios, without worrying about technical feasibility for now.

- **1.** (Idea 4) Intput : Talking few hours ago > Samples of talks shaped into ambient melodies few hours after.

- **2.** (Idea 5) Moving around the robot would make it "happier", it would decide to change its color from Grey to Pink for 5 hours. Its stamina of happiness would be then 5 hours. It could aso manifest its happiness by projecting colorful and warmful lights around itself. 
             
             
# EXERCICE 3 
Using your ideas from Exercice 1 and 2, write a short paragraph in markdown that describes what your soft robot does, where it resides in the home, and who it interacts with. Feed this text to an AI and begin an iterative process to refine your to refine your concept.
Following this, create a series of quick prototypes that summarize the key points from your concept and your conversations with the AI.

All prototypes below come from Idea 4. (for now)


- **1.**  

Prototype 1: The Echo Tapestry

Physical Design: The Echo Tapestry takes the form of a hanging textile, woven with conductive threads that serve as both aesthetic and functional elements. The threads shimmer and pulse gently when the robot activates. The tapestry blends technology with the organic form of traditional fabric, suggesting a merging of the past and future, of memory and sensation.

Sound Output: Conversations are captured by the tapestry’s embedded microphones, then replayed in subtly manipulated forms. The fabric itself becomes the sound source, emitting low-level, organic noises like the rustling of wind or the distant murmur of conversation. Speech is transformed into a warm, ambient hum that blends into the room’s atmosphere. The longer the robot “listens,” the more abstract and otherworldly the sounds become, evoking the surreal, dream-like states found in Altered States.

Construction: The tapestry would be constructed using conductive fabric and micro-speakers woven into the design. Simple signal-processing software would handle the manipulation of sound in real-time. The result would be an immersive audio experience tied directly to a piece of art that serves both as decoration and as a listening device.

Prototype 2: The Whisperscape

Physical Design: The Whisperscape is a small, robotic orb that hovers gently near a corner of the room, similar to the drones in Solaris. Its surface is covered in soft, textured fabric that absorbs sound, while its internal mechanisms allow it to move slowly, drawing near to where conversations have occurred. The orb has gentle, shifting colors, creating a calming ambiance in the room.

Sound Output: The Whisperscape captures sounds from its environment, focusing on the emotional undertones of conversations. It transforms these sounds into a whisper-like tone, creating an intimate connection with the listener. The soft whispers can evoke memories, fading in and out like the fleeting nature of time, reminiscent of the memory sequences in La Jetée. It might generate sound layers that gradually build upon each other, allowing the listener to feel enveloped in a cocoon of sound.

Construction: The orb can be constructed using lightweight materials like plastic or 3D-printed components, containing a compact microphone and speaker system inside. Its movement could be powered by simple servos or motors, allowing it to glide smoothly across surfaces. The sound processing unit could utilize basic machine learning algorithms to analyze and respond to the emotional context of the captured conversations.

Prototype 3: The Timekeeper’s Mirror

Physical Design: The Timekeeper’s Mirror is a large circular wall-mounted mirror, but its surface is slightly translucent, and beneath it, soft pulses of light move in response to the room’s acoustic activity. The mirror plays with the idea of reflection, both literal and metaphorical, as it “reflects” sound from earlier in the day and reinterprets it in the present moment.

Sound Output: As conversations happen, the mirror passively “records” the room’s sonic activity, capturing fragments of dialogue, the clink of dishes, or the shuffle of footsteps. In silence, the mirror emits faint reverberations, transforming the previous sounds into soft ripples of ambient noise. The way the sounds are stretched and warped creates a sense of temporal dislocation, much like the narrative fragmentation in La Jetée or the temporal loops of Solaris. A word once spoken may now become an elongated tone, while the sound of laughter might become a distant, melodic echo, like memories being stretched across time.

Construction: The mirror could be built using a thin OLED screen behind a translucent reflective surface. Microphones around the frame capture sound, while the internal system processes and distorts audio. The shifting light patterns could be controlled with simple LED strips that correspond to the intensity and volume of the transformed sounds. A small sound system hidden within the mirror’s frame plays back the ambient audio.

Prototype 4: The Liquid Memory Pool

Physical Design: A shallow, circular basin, filled with a viscous, clear fluid. Beneath the surface, lights shimmer and ripple as if reflecting the intangible fluidity of time. The edges of the basin feature softly lit markings that pulse slowly when the robot begins to process the sounds it has absorbed. Its design would fit into a living room like an art object, appearing serene and still until it begins to resonate with sounds.

Sound Output: The pool “samples” conversations by seemingly absorbing them into its liquid surface, subtly emitting small, organic noises like distant ripples or underwater reverberations. Over time, the robot transforms speech into tones that seem to bubble up from the depths of the pool. Imagine hearing your own words as distant echoes, as though they are being remembered by water. In the quiet of the night, soft drones or pulsations can be heard, growing more abstract the longer the room stays still.

Construction: The basin could use a simple audio system with underwater speakers, producing soft, vibrating sounds through the fluid. Sensors embedded within the fluid’s base detect when the room falls quiet, triggering the gradual release of past sound samples, which are stretched, layered, and modulated. The lights could change color depending on the type of sound being emitted.

You are a designer in soft robotics, make an image from this description of my robot prototype, keep in mind that the image must be feasible, it's a prototype.
